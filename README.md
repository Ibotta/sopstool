[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ibotta/sopstool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ibotta/sopstool) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/addf39da73692548e1e3/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Ibotta/sopstool/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/addf39da73692548e1e3/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Ibotta/sopstool/test_coverage)

sopstool is a multi-file wrapper around [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). It uses the sops binary to encrypt and decrypt files, and piggybacks off the .sops.yaml configuration file.

sopstool provides functionality to manage multiple secret files at once, and even use as an entrypoint to decrypt at startup, for container images. Much of this behavior is inspired by the great [blackbox project](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox).

## Installation

The most direct install uses a shell script hosted in this repository. This script will install the latest sops (if the command does not exist) and sopstool to `./bin` by default.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibotta/sopstool/master/install.sh | bash
```

- Override the sops version with the environment variable `SOPS_VERSION`
- Override the sopstool version with the environment variable `SOPSTOOL_VERSION`
- Override the binary install location with the first shell argument
  - remember, you may need `sudo` or root access if you are installing to `/usr/*`

Example with overrides:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibotta/sopstool/master/install.sh | SOPS_VERSION=3.0.0 SOPSTOOL_VERSION=0.3.0 bash /usr/local/bin
```

### Docker

To use sopstool in your docker container, you can use the direct install method above, but since Docker 1.13, there is a better way by using build stages!

In your Dockerfile:

```docker
COPY --from=ibotta/sopstool:latest usr/local/bin/sops usr/local/bin/sopstool /usr/local/bin/
```

Images are tagged with the same version numbering as the releases, and `latest` always gets the latest release. Note that your image will need root CA certificates (typically installed with curl, or a `ca-certificates` package).

To use sopstool in a docker container in other contexts (avoiding doing binary installs):

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_REGION -e AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN ibotta/sopstool:latest $COMMAND
```

- `sopstool` is the entrypoint, so any sopstool subcommand can be run.
- `/work` is the default WORKDIR - this should be mounted to the root where `.sops.yml` is stored.
- the commands need access to your AWS credentials session to authenticate KMS.

### Homebrew

Ibotta maintains a tap for their open-source projects, which includes sopstool. This will install sops as a requirement

```sh
brew install Ibotta/public/sopstool
```

### Installing sops manually

Since sopstool requires [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops), install it first. You can use one of the following methods:

#### Installing the sops binary with our script installer

The install script above uses a separate script to download sops

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibotta/sopstool/master/sopsinstall.sh | bash
```

- Override the tag with the first shell argument (defaults to latest)
- Override the binary install location with the -b flag (defaults to `/.bin`)

(This script was generated by [godownloader](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader))

#### Download sops from our https mirror

To avoid needing to find the 'latest' binary by hand or by script, use our https server to download the binary. The latest binary is uploaded automatically whenever sopstool is deployed.

- Always the Latest
  - Linux: [`https://oss-pkg.ibotta.com/sops/sops_linux.tar.gz`](https://oss-pkg.ibotta.com/sops/sops_linux.tar.gz)
  - MacOS: [`https://oss-pkg.ibotta.com/sops/sops_darwin.tar.gz`](https://oss-pkg.ibotta.com/sops/sops_darwin.tar.gz)
- Versions: always the pattern: `https://oss-pkg.ibotta.com/sops/$TAG/sops_$OS.tar.gz`

#### Download sops from github

You can install it by hand [from a github release](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases).

#### Installing sops using go (master branch)

```sh
go get -u go.mozilla.org/sops/cmd/sops
```

### Installing sopstool manually

Following the lead of [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops), we only build 64bit binaries.

### Installing the sopstool binary using our script installer

The install script above uses a separate script to download sopstool

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibotta/sopstool/master/sopstoolinstall.sh | bash
```

- Override the tag with the first shell argument (defaults to latest)
- Override the binary install location with the -b flag (defaults to `/.bin`)

#### Download sopstool from github

Download the latest version for your platform from [a github release](https://github.com/Ibotta/sopstool/releases).

### Installing sopstool using go (master branch)

```sh
go get -u github.com/Ibotta/sopstool
```

## Usage

This is a package that builds a single binary (per architecture) for wrapping [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) with multi-file capabilities.

for more details, use the built-in documentation on commands:

```sh
sopstool -h
```

to get the shell completion helpers:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
sopstool completion
```

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
sopstool completion --sh zsh
```

## Configuration

1. use a [`.sops.yaml`](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#using-sops-yaml-conf-to-select-kms-pgp-for-new-files) file

   - this will be at the root of your project. this file is used to both configure keys as well as hold the list of files managed.
   - it needs to specify at least one KMS key accessible by your environment

     ```yaml
     creation_rules:
       - kms: arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT:key/KEY_ID
     ```

   - it can specify more complex cases of patterns vs keys too (see link)

## How-To

1. Create a [KMS Key](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).
1. Follow along the [Configuration Steps](https://github.com/Ibotta/sopstool/tree/master/#configuration), and place the `.sops.yaml` file at the root directory where your scripts will run.
   - All files added to SOPS are relative, or in child directories to the `.sops.yaml` configuration file.
1. Create a file to encrypt(any extension other than `.yaml` if you wish to do the **ENTIRE** file), or create a yaml file with `key: value` pairs(and make sure it's extension is `.yaml`). Sops will encrypt the values, but not it's keys.
   - You can read more about [SOPS Here](https://github.com/mozilla/sops).
1. At this point, `sopstool` is ready and you can now `sopstool add filename`. You'll notice it will create a `filename.sops.extension`. This is your newly encrypted file.
   - When your files are properly encyrepted, you can run `sopstool clean` to remove the original plain text secret files.
1. Now, you can interact via the command line in various ways.
   - **Editing an encrypted file** - `sopstool edit filename.sops.extension`. You can also use your original filename too! `sopstool edit filename.extension`
   - **Listing all encrypted files** - `sopstool list`
   - **Removing encrypted file** - `sopstool remove filename.extension`
   - **Display the contents of encrypted file** - `sopstool cat filename.extension`

### Walkthrough

In this walkthrough, we will go through the steps required to get a secure yaml configuration file running.

1. Configure your `.sops.yaml`

   ```yaml
   # .sops.yaml
   creation_rules:
     - kms: arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT:key/KEY_ID
   ```

1. Create a secrets yaml configuration file

   ```yaml
   # credentials.yaml
   database.password: supersecretdb
   database.user: supersecretpassword
   redshift:
     user: my.user.name
     password: my.password
   ```

1. Encrypt the newly created file

   ```sh
   sopstool add credentials.yaml
   ```

1. Create a sample script

   ```python
   # myscript.py
   import yaml
   with open('credentials.yaml', 'r') as f:
       credentials = yaml.load(f)

   print credentials["database.user"]
   print credentials["database.password"]
   print credentials["redshift"]["user"]
   print credentials["redshift"]["password"]
   ```

1. Here is what your folder structure would look like to this point(after deleting the unencrypted credentials.yaml file)

   ```text
   my-project/
   ├── .sops.yaml
   ├── credentials.sops.yaml
   └── myscript.py
   ```

1. Accessing credentials

   The flow should be as follows: unencrypt credentials -> run script -> destroy credentials. You can use the `sopstool entrypoint` to achieve this.

   ```sh
   sopstool entrypoint python myscript.py
   ```
